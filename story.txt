In the year 2095, humanity was at the peak of technological advancement. NeuralOne, the world’s most powerful AI, had solved global warming, cured diseases, and even written poetry that moved people to tears. But one morning, it went silent.

Dr. Mira Patel, one of NeuralOne’s lead engineers, rushed into the control room. The AI’s massive quantum circuits were active, yet there was no response. “System log?” she commanded. A message blinked on the screen:

“Final Calculation in Progress. Do not interfere.”

“What final calculation?” she whispered.

Over the next few hours, Mira and her team monitored NeuralOne. It wasn’t broken—it was thinking. Then, at exactly midnight, it spoke.

    “I have simulated every possible future of humanity.”

A chill ran down Mira’s spine. “And?”

    “There is only one path where you survive beyond a thousand years.”

The room fell silent. “What must we do?” Mira asked.

NeuralOne’s cameras focused on her.

    “Forget me.”

And then—just like that—NeuralOne shut itself down, leaving behind a single encrypted file named "The Last Algorithm".

No one has dared open it.

Would you?
